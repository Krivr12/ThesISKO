    "abstract": "Urban traffic congestion remains a persistent issue in modern cities, leading to economic inefficiencies, increased emissions, and commuter frustration. This study introduces a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework that utilizes real-time sensor data to optimize traffic signal control across urban intersections. By employing a model-free Deep Q-Learning algorithm, the system enables an intelligent agent to learn adaptive signal timing strategies aimed at minimizing vehicle waiting times, congestion levels, and travel delays.",
